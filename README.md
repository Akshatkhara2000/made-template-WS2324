## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->

The goal of this project is to analyze the restaurants in Banglore, india. When looking for food and restaurants in a particular area to order from and read reviews about, Zomato is one of the most popular apps. Zomato has not only made it possible to order food while relaxing at home, but it has also given users access to a single platform that provides additional restaurant information. Bangalore is the place to be a foodie, with young people, working professionals, and students occupying every available space. The city also contributes significantly to Zomato's national order volume.
